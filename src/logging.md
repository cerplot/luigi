* Disable Auto-vacuum: Auto-vacuuming can slow down write operations because it involves moving pages on the disk. You can disable it using the PRAGMA auto_vacuum = NONE; command. However, this might increase the storage space used by the database.  

* Use EXCLUSIVE Locking Mode: In EXCLUSIVE locking mode, once a process locks the database, no other process can access the database until the lock is released. This can speed up write operations because SQLite doesn't need to acquire and release locks for each transaction. You can enable it using the PRAGMA locking_mode = EXCLUSIVE; command.

* Use a Larger Cache Size: SQLite uses an internal cache to hold the database pages that are frequently accessed. Increasing the cache size can improve write performance. You can increase it using the PRAGMA cache_size = -kibibytes; command.

* Batching Writes: performing multiple write operations within a single transaction can significantly improve performance. This is because SQLite coalesces these writes into a single disk write operation when the transaction is committed.  
* Synchronous Mode: By default, SQLite waits until data has been confirmed written to disk before continuing. You can change this behavior by setting the PRAGMA synchronous command to OFF or NORMAL. This can improve performance, but at the risk of database corruption in the event of a crash or power loss.  
* Journal Mode: Changing the journal mode to MEMORY or OFF can also improve write performance. However, like with the synchronous mode, this can increase the risk of database corruption.  
* Page Size: Increasing the page size can improve write performance for larger databases. You can change the page size using the PRAGMA page_size command.
* Memory-mapped I/O allows SQLite to treat the database file as if it were in-memory, which can result in faster read and write operations. You can enable memory-mapped I/O in SQLite by setting the PRAGMA mmap_size command. The value you set for mmap_size determines the maximum number of bytes that SQLite can use for memory-mapped I/O. For example, to set the maximum to 1GB, you would use the following command: rc = sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA mmap_size=1073741824;", NULL, 0, &zErrMsg);
* Write coalescing is a feature that is automatically handled by SQLite. It's a part of SQLite's transaction mechanism. When you perform multiple write operations within a single transaction, SQLite will coalesce these writes into a single disk write operation when the transaction is committed. This can significantly improve performance when you're performing many write operations.
* Increase the SQLite Heap Size: SQLite uses a heap for memory allocation during query processing. Increasing the heap size can improve performance for complex queries. You can increase the heap size using the PRAGMA soft_heap_limit command.
* Use Prepared Statements: Prepared statements can be faster than regular SQL statements because they are parsed only once, whereas regular SQL statements are parsed every time they are executed.
* Use the sqlite3_exec() Function Instead of sqlite3_step() for Single SQL Statements: The sqlite3_exec() function is a wrapper around sqlite3_prepare(), sqlite3_step(), and sqlite3_finalize(), and can be faster for single SQL statements.
* Use the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) Mode: WAL mode can provide more concurrency as readers do not block writers and a writer does not block readers. Reading and writing can proceed concurrently. WAL mode is especially suited for applications with more write transactions. You can enable it using the PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; command.  
* Use PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;: This setting stores temporary tables and indices, used by SQLite for processing queries, in memory rather than on disk. This can speed up operations that make heavy use of temporary tables or indices.  
  Use PRAGMA threads=N;: This setting can be used to set the maximum number of auxiliary threads that SQLite will spawn to help out with a query. For a multi-core system, this can be set to the number of cores.
